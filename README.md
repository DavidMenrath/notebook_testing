# Python Programming Course

Welcome to our **Introduction to Python Programming** course! This course is designed for beginners who want to learn Python from scratch. We have used **Jupyter Notebooks** to create an interactive learning experience where you can read explanations, write and execute Python code, and see results immediately. This format is widely used for learning, experimenting with code, and data analysis because it combines code, output, and documentation in a single file.

## Getting Started

To use Jupyter Notebooks, you typically need **Python** installed on your computer. However, to make it easier to get started without any setup, you can run the notebooks directly in your web browser using online services. This allows you to start coding right away without installing anything.

Below, we present different ways to run the notebooks. Choose the option that best fits your needs.

## Running the Notebooks

### 1. Run Online with Binder

Binder lets you run Jupyter Notebooks directly in your web browser without installing anything. This is the easiest way to get started quickly. However, Binder does not save your changes permanently, so if you modify the notebooks, you need to **download your work manually** before closing the session.

### 2. Run Online with GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces allows you to run the notebooks in a full **VS Code environment in your browser**. This option provides a more powerful development environment and **automatically saves your work**, but it requires a GitHub account and may have resource limitations on free accounts.

### 3. Run Online with Google Colab

Google Colab is a free cloud-based notebook service provided by Google. It allows you to run Jupyter Notebooks without any installation. One key advantage is that Colab **automatically saves your work in Google Drive**, making it easy to continue where you left off. However, you will need a **Google account** to use it, and some advanced Python libraries may require additional setup.

### 4. Run Offline on Your Computer

If you prefer to work on your own computer, you can **download the repository** and run the notebooks locally. This gives you full control over your environment and data but requires setting up Python and Jupyter Notebook.

We will provide a separate guide on how to install Python and Jupyter Notebook for offline use.

We hope this course helps you learn Python in an easy and interactive way.
